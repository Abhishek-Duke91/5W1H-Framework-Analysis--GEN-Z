This repository contains my work and insights on analyzing the career aspirations of Gen Z, developed during my internship at KultureHire. This project addresses the challenges Gen Z faces in pursuing desired career roles and how employers struggle to attract, retain, and manage this new generation of talent. My task involved creating a comprehensive document that applies the "5W1H" problem-solving framework to clearly define the problem and provide recommendations for both Gen Z and employers.

Project Overview
Problem Statement:
Many Gen Z individuals feel that their career aspirations are often unheard by employers, making it difficult to pursue roles that align with their goals. At the same time, employers face challenges in attracting, retaining, and managing Gen Z employees, given their distinct expectations and aspirations.

Objective:
The goal of this analysis is to understand these challenges better and provide actionable insights and recommendations for both Gen Z freshers and employers.

Analytical Approaches
This project applies:

Descriptive Analytics: To explore and understand the current career aspirations and trends among Gen Z.
Prescriptive Analytics: To offer actionable recommendations addressing the challenges faced by both Gen Z and employers.
Approach: 5W1H Framework
I used the 5W1H framework to break down the problem. This structured approach helps answer:

Who is affected by the problem?
What are the specific issues?
When does the problem arise?
Where is the problem most prevalent?
Why are these issues occurring?
How can both Gen Z and employers address these challenges?

Problem Analysis: In-depth breakdown of Gen Z's career aspirations.
